# Closing Spring 2020

After declining attendance and less giving, the leadership team was forced to ask, "Should we continue to exist as a church?" After prayer, conversations, and soul searching, the answer seems to be, "No."

## Current Schedule
*   Mar 1 - First Sunday
*   Mar 8 - Memories Sunday
*   Mar 15 - Worship Sunday
*   Mar 22 - Work Sunday
*   Mar 29 - Baptism Sunday
